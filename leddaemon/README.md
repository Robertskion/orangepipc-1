leddaemon

Use the Orange Pi PC onboard LEDs to monitor system load and cpu temperature.

The red LED lights up when the system load exceeds 1.

The green LED, will light up when the daemon is running and it will blink when the temperature exceeds 60 degrees Celsius.

Of course these defaults can be changed in the script.

Multi threaded and deamonizing python script.
